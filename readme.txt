Requires at least: 4.2
Tested up to: 5.9
Stable tag: 1.9.4.1
License: MIT

Manage data sets and display them as charts in WordPress.

== Description ==

Allows you to manage data sets via a spreadsheet interface and present that data in chart form via the Chart.js or [Highcharts](https://github.com/methnen/m-chart-highcharts-library/) chart libraries.  The charts can then be embedded into a regular post via a handy shortcode.

**Note:** Starting with version 1.8 the Chart.js library is no longer on the 2.x.x branch which introduces some [breaking changes](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/v3-migration.html). This will probably only affect you if you were modifying the default Chart.js behavior in some way.

**Note:** Starting with version 1.7 Highcharts is no longer included with this plugin by default. If you'd still like to use the features that require Higcharts please install the [M Chart Highcharts Library](https://github.com/methnen/m-chart-highcharts-library/) plugin before installing this update.

For full documentation please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/methnen/m-chart/wiki).

2. Click 'Activate' in the Plugins admin panel
